        <h1>Graph theoretic analysis of Smart grid</h1>
        <p> key words: —Power system analysis, graph theory, scenorio modeling, metrics study.</p><br>
        <p><b>Project Introduction:</b> The tool is aimed to convert the responses coming from the
           dynamic power system into a dynamic graph and visualize it in the python 
           platform. The living data information is received from a simulator to update 
           the graph and some graph theory metric are chosen to analyze it. There are 
           some discussion of the results based on graph specification to highlight the 
           relationship between the graph characteristics and power system features. 
           Finally we determine whether or how graph theory can analyze the electrical system.
        </p><br>
        <p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Xigui0314/Graph-theoretic-analysis-of-Smart-Grid/blob/master/Code">plain source code</a> for the project.

        <p> The function create the Directed graph with The nodes represent generator and bus have the features of voltage level. 
                The edges represent for lines and transformers have the features of resistance and reactance value.<br>
                The procudure of the stage is: Open the file, Tokenize the file, extract the value and add Nodes/Edges.

        <p>  In the IEEE power system, the spring layout looks like an electrical network. 
            In the spring system, the two elements are mass and spring. Where the mass is analogous to a generator
             or the load bus and the spring is analogous to a transmission line that connects the generator.
             Therefore we choose the <b>spring layout</b>.<br>
             For the values , we keet it as per unit: <br>
             For example, if V=0.9, means new Voltages=90% * old voltage. The changing of color can reflect the voltage change.
             Typically, the voltage value fluctuates more than 10%, and it will affect the power system.<br>
             Here is the color table to reflect the voltage level status:

                    <p>
                    In the graph theory,, Google PageRank (Google PR) takes the the structure of the incoming links to computes 
                    a ranking of the nodes. In Google search engine, the PageRank algorithm is one of the methods Google uses to
                     determine a page's relevance or importance. Relevant pages are more likely to appear at the top of the search
                      results due to it higher PageRank value. In this case, the node with a higher PageRank is more significant 
                      in this communicationx network.

                   <p>
                 The eigenvalue is computed from the Laplacian matrix for the graph. 
                 The Laplacian matrix is equal to the graph degree matrix minus the adjacency matrix.
                 Taking the weight from the edge to build the Laplacian matrix and get the eigenvalue from it for the graph.

                   <p>
                    Get the weight from the edge and build the vector, which can be multiplied by the graph’s adjacency 
                    matrix and return itself. Also it can be referred that the Eigenvector centrality is one of the characteristic 
                    of the graph’s adjacency matrix. It is considered as a specific pattern of graph connections returns a set 
                    of vertex values to described the equilibrium property.
